Any support is _greatly_ appreciated, but donations are *not* and will *never* be necessary to use my software!

(I also have a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/akemin_dayo) page, but I would prefer you only use that if you _must_ for some reason, because transactions processed through Ko-fi have a fee deducted from them and can sometimes even be delayed.)

Otherwise, please report all other issues here in this reddit thread so others will be able to share knowledge.

# For new users: So what *is* PreferenceOrganizer 2?

A simple and free alternative to PreferenceFolders, compatible with iOS 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.

PreferenceOrganiser 2 organises and de-clutters your Preferences app into several configurable categories for ease of navigation.

Uses [KarenPrefs](https://github.com/angelXwind/KarenPrefs) and [KarenLocalizer](https://github.com/angelXwind/KarenLocalizer).

All features are configurable through PreferenceOrganizer 2's preference pane in the Settings app.
